### Adding a steam game

In the Steam app, to find a game's ID, go to the game's store or library page. The ID isn't directly displayed, but you can share the game's page via email or social media to see the URL containing the game's ID, which is the number after "/app/" in the link.

The command you wil need to use to lauch your steam game looks like this

start steam://rungameid/[the_ID_goes_here]
